This repository will contain all non-main modules I make for Multiplayer Template,
either for pure content for a server or libraries in general.

I cannot ensure a range of versions where they will work, but unless there are no updates in a long time, assume it's latest.

If you use them, I'd love to get credit for the main library or the modules if it isn't for private usage. Feel free to ask me how to use the libraries in discord: @leinad677yt
